# Advanced Pathfinding Visualization

A sophisticated pathfinding visualization system implementing multiple advanced algorithms:

- A* (A-star) Pathfinding
- Jump Point Search (JPS)
- Bidirectional Theta* Algorithm
- Flow Field Pathfinding
- Hierarchical Pathfinding (HPA*)

## Architecture

The project is organized as a monorepo with three main components:

- **Client**: Next.js application with React components for visualization
- **Server**: Express backend for algorithm execution
- **Shared**: Common code and algorithm implementations

## Features

- Interactive grid for algorithm visualization
- Multiple advanced pathfinding algorithms
- Real-time performance metrics
- Algorithm comparison tool
- Configurable parameters and obstacles

## Technical Stack

- TypeScript
- Next.js & React
- Express.js
- Docker for containerization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### Docker Setup
